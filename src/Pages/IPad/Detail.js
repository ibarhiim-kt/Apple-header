						Monthly pricing is available when you select Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) as payment type at checkout at Apple, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit. Financing terms vary by product. Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI and are subject to your card’s variable APR. See the <a href="#" className='underline'>Apple&nbsp;Card Customer Agreement</a>  for more information. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at special storefronts. The last month’s payment for each product will be the product's purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI financing is subject to change at any time for any reason, including but not limited to, installment term lengths and eligible products. See <a href="#" className='underline'>support.apple.com/kb/HT211204</a> for information about upcoming changes to ACMI financing.

						Apple&nbsp;Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR payment option that is only available if you select it at checkout in the U.S. for eligible products purchased at Apple&nbsp;Store locations,
                        <a href="#" className='underline'>apple.com</a> , the Apple&nbsp;Store app, or by calling 1‑800‑MY‑APPLE, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit. See <a href="#" className='underline'>support.apple.com/kb/HT211204</a>  for more information about eligible products. APR ranges may vary based on when you accepted an Apple&nbsp;Card. Cardholders who accept an Apple&nbsp;Card on and/or after October 1, 2024: Variable APRs for Apple&nbsp;Card, other than ACMI, range from 18.74% to 28.99% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of October 1, 2024. Existing cardholders: See your Customer Agreement for applicable rates and fee.  If you buy an ACMI‑eligible product by choosing to pay in full with Apple Card (instead of using ACMI), that purchase is subject to the Apple Card variable APR, not 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on ACMI purchases are subject to the variable APR, not 0% APR.  When you buy an iPhone with ACMI, you’ll need to select AT&T, Boost Mobile, T‑Mobile, or Verizon as your carrier when you check out. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any time. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs; or on refurbished devices. The last month’s payment for each product will be the product’s purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI financing is subject to change at any time for any reason, including but not limited to installment term lengths and eligible products. See <a href="#" className='underline'>support.apple.com/kb/HT211204</a>  for information about upcoming changes to ACMI financing. See the <a href="#" className='underline'>Apple&nbsp;Card Customer Agreement</a>  for more information about ACMI&nbsp;financing.
